📊 Data Visualization Board
📝 Project Overview

The Data Visualization Board is a responsive web application built entirely using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js — without any external libraries.
It provides a complete visualization of sales data, showing monthly performance, percentage distribution, and projected sales trends.
This project demonstrates the power of React components and pure front-end logic to create interactive data dashboards.

🎯 Features

📈 Bar Chart Visualization:
Displays monthly sales data (January–June) using dynamic bars for clear comparison.

🥧 Pie Chart Display:
Represents each month’s contribution to total sales through a color-coded pie chart (implemented purely with React and CSS).

📊 Sales Percentage Summary:
Shows the percentage contribution of each month, helping users identify growth and performance trends.

📅 Sales Projection & Forecast:
Includes projections for July–December with estimated sales values, demonstrating basic data forecasting logic.

💡 Forecast Explanation:
Contains a short description of what a sales forecast is and why it matters for business planning.
